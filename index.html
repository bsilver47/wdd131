            <p>My name is Benjamin Sterling Silver. I live in Arizona, am from New York, and have lived in a handful of
                places across the US. I am currently a student of BYU-Pathway, but graduated from BYU-Idaho and attended
                UVU and WGU.</p>

        <p>I may currently live in Arizona but I am originally from New York which has a famous skyline. I took this
            picture when my family visited the Statue of Liberty. Taken from Liberty Island, this picture highlights
            many famous buildings, but the easiest to spot is the Freedom Tower, built at Ground Zero, signifying that
            no terrorist attack or external force can shake our country nor our freedom.</p>
