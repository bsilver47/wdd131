            <p>"36 That the rights of the priesthood are inseparably connected with the powers of heaven, and that
                the powers of heaven
                cannot be controlled nor handled only upon the principles of righteousness.

                37 That they may be conferred upon us, it is true; but when we undertake to cover our sins, or to
                gratify our pride, our
                vain ambition, or to exercise control or dominion or compulsion upon the souls of the children of
                men, in any degree of
                unrighteousness, behold, the heavens withdraw themselves; the Spirit of the Lord is grieved; and
                when it is withdrawn,
                Amen to the priesthood or the authority of that man."</p>

                work unto my name,
                and those sons of men go with all their might and with all they have to perform that work, and cease
                not their
                diligence, and their enemies come upon them and hinder them from performing that work, behold, it
                behooveth me to
                require that work no more at the hands of those sons of men, but to accept of their offerings."</p>
